Let's work !

# 1. About the project
  Do you know nowadays most do not care much about classification waste ? According to “Song tre news” most citizens in Ha Noi do not care about classification waste in the city. The reason is that they have a lack of knowledge about classification waste. Understand the importance of that we have decided to create the project.
## Project
   This project is called "Waste Classification using Teachable Machine," specialized in collecting, managing, and clearly classifying waste by specific material types, rather than simply "organic" or "inorganic." This website serves as a rich image data bank, specifically designed for training AImodels. 
## Purpose
  The main purpose is to provide high-quality, detailed, and diverse data for the development of AI systems on Teachable Machine or other platforms, aiming to automatically classify waste based on material. This directly contributes to solving urgent environmental problems, supporting more efficient recycling, minimizing pollution, and moving towards a circular economy.

## What does this project do?
  We're building a website that acts like a "bank" of many different waste images.

  These images are used to "teach" (train) AI systems.
## Why are we doing this?
  To provide good, diverse data for AI, helping it automatically identify and classify waste.

  This is very important for solving environmental problems:
  
      It helps with more efficient recycling
      
      It reduces pollution.
      
      It contributes to building a more sustainable economy (circular economy).
      
# 2. How did we create it?
  We have built a very detailed waste dataset to train our AI.
  ## Initial Data Sources:
  ### We started with image data from Kaggle, including:

| Waste Type | Image Count | 
|:--------|:-------:|
| Automobile Wastes   | 1100   |
| Battery Waste   | 580   |
| E-waste   | 710   |
| glass waste   | 900   |
|  light bulbs   | 700   |
| metal waste   | 800   |
|  organic waste   | 400   |
| paper waste   | 800   |
|  plastic waste   | 1000   |

   ## Expanding and Enhancing Data:

  ### To help the AI learn better, we've "enriched" our data. This means we modify the original images by changing:
      
   -Brightness
   
   -Contrast
   
   -Shooting angles
    
  ### This creates countless variations of the same waste type, helping the AI recognize it better in various situations.

  ## Clear and Accurate Classification:
  ### Instead of simply labeling as "inorganic," we classify waste very specifically by material type. For example:

      "Electronics"
   
      "Automotive"
   
      "Glass"
   
      "Metal"
   
      "Paper"
   
      "Fabric"
   
  ### We have a very strict moderation process to ensure the data is always correct and of the highest quality. This helps the AI distinguish waste quickly and precisely.

## Diversity Within Each Waste Type:

### Within each waste type (e.g., plastic bottles), we include images with:

  Different shapes
  
  Different sizes
  
  Different colors
  
  Different states (e.e.g., intact plastic bottles, crumpled plastic bottles)
  
### This diversity helps the AI model adapt effectively to many real-world scenarios.


# 3. What the project can do?
  ### It can identify and classify waste through very detailed images.

  ### Displays clear, detailed metrics.

  ### Shows a reasonable accuracy rate.

  ### User-friendly interface.
  
# 4. It very usefull in the future
  ## Our Big Goals:

  ### Automate waste sorting better: This means classifying trash precisely to cut down pollution and make recycling super efficient.

  ### Be a leading platform for sharing data: We want to build a place where people can easily share data and work together on AI solutions for the environment. This will lead to new, smart ways to handle waste.
